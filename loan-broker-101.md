# Loan broker 101

The loan-brokerage business is fairly simple. There are three types of
actors interaction in the market.

- Consumers - Who are looking to refinance loans
- Brokers - Who help customers `Consumers` compare `Lenders`
- Lenders - Who offer credit to the customer.

Loan brokers aren't needed, per se, but they exist to because
consumers don't have the resources (time and effort). The basic
process is as follows:

1. A broker approaches through some channel, for example, their website.
2. The broker collects the information necessary to apply for the loan
3. The broker sends the loan to lenders that might be interested.
4. Each lender makes a decision on whether to extend credit or not,
   informing the broker of their decision.
5. The broker presents the offers (if any) to the customer
6. The customer decides on which loan they want.
7. The broker informs the `lender` who has won the customer that their bid is accepted.
8. The lender sends a loan agreement, called a debenture to the
   customer, either digitally or in the mail.
9. The customer signs the debenture.
10. The lender pays out (disburses) the loan to the customer.
11. The `broker` receives a commission if the loan was payed out.

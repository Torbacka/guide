# Being a Buddy

When someone joins the team they are assigned a buddy. Being someones
buddy is a great opportunity to get to know someone who is just
joining the team.



As someone's buddy you will help the new hire with a number of things:

- Working together on the new hire's first-project
- Teaching a the new hire how we do things at Klira
- Answering questions that the new hire might have about the company
- Making sure the new-hire is involved in the social activities

Your manager will make sure that your personal work-load is reduced so
that you can focus on being a good buddy.

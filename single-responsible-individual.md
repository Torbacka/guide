# Single Responsible Individual (SRI)

At Klira, we use the concept of a Single Responsible Individual who's
job it is to get a particular project to market. When you're the
single responsible individual for a project it is your job to ensure
that all critical bugs and all must have features within the scope of
the project are addressed, even if you're not the person writing the
code. You're also responsible for making sure that the feature is
deployed in production and if the feature is internal that there is a
plan for implementing the feature.

In short as SRI you:

- Decide on features to be implemented. Aiming for a Minimum Viable
  Product or increment.
- Get graphical design for the project, if necessary.
- Get developers to implement your feature.
- Test your feature ensuring that all components are integrated and
  working.
- Report issues and ensure that identified issues are fixed.
- Design a deployment plan with all the stakeholders.
- Ensure that the feature starts delivering value.

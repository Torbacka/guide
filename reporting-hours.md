# Reporting hours

If you're working part-time you will be given a spreadsheet for
reporting hours. The spreadsheet has two columns, the date and the
number of hours. For a full day's work you should report 8 hours. If
you want to work weekends or evenings you need to agree with your
manager beforehand. The exception being emergencies or requests from
your manager. In the spreadsheet you should use one workbook (tab) for
each salary period, in Sweden salary is paid monthly on 25th, so each
sheet should start with 26th and end with 25th.

An example of a hour reporting spreadsheet:

| Date       | Hours |
|------------|-------|
| 2018-01-01 | 8     |
| 2018-01-02 | 8     |

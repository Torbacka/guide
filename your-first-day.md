# Your First Day With Klira

First of all Welcome to Klira! We hope that you're going to have a
really great time here. This document is meant to help you get off to
a great start here.

Most importantly you will be assigned a buddy, its your buddy's job to
help you get off the ground with your work. If you're a software
engineer, you and your buddy will be pair-programming/pair-designing
on your first project.

Your buddy will help you get the source code, sketch-files or excel
spreadsheets setup. You will also be given a Google Account and Slack
account, and get invited to the Github project.

The first important thing you will do is probably be your first
stand-up meeting. You can find more information about our [standup
meetings here](./standup.md). When a new team member joins we will
also do a name-round in addition to the normal standup.

During your first week we will make sure to schedule a visit with our
sales and customer support teams so get a feel for our customers. This
should hopefully get you a better understanding of the business side
of things.

If Will is your manager then make sure to read his [`README`-file](https://github.com/williamhogman/working-with-will/)

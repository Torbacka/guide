For developers and designers we offer your choice of hardware. For
other roles we use Chromebooks for security.

When ordering in Sweden we use [Dustin.se](https://dustin.se) for
larger purchases (Computers) and [Webhallen.se](https://webhallen.se)
for smaller purchases (Keyboard/mice)

If you're working in the `dev-room` we will also provide a pair of noise
cancelling headphones of your choice.

## Dev laptop recommendation

For dev-laptops you absolutely need to get a model with 16gb RAM or
more.

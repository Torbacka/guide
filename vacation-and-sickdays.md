# Vacation & Sickdays

**TL;DR:**

- Vacation: Unlimited
- Sick days: Unlimited
- Remote work: Once in awhile (because IRL is important)

## Vacation

Taking time away from work can be important to maintain a good
work/life balance. Taking a break is a good way to avoid burnout.

We have a "no ask" time off policy. This means that you do not need
approval to take time off, unless you ask for more than 25 days
consecutively.

We offer unlimited vacation, if you need time-off, you take it.

This comes with some responsibilities though, you're expected to make
sure that all your deliverables are complete or delegated to someone
else before you leave. Your manager can help you with this.

How to Vacation:

1. Add an event in the `KREW AFK` calendar with a title like
   this: `[VACATION] $NICKNAME`
2. Say something in your team chatchannel e.g. #dev
2. When leaving: Set your Slack status to `Vacation from YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Post a daily picture in `#random` if internet connectivity allows

## Sick days

If you're sick or for some reasons aren't feeling creative we think
that showing up to work is just a waste of time, you should be at home
focusing on getting better.

If its just a cold, [working from home](#working-from-home) might be a
great way to kill some time, or you know just watch Netflix or something.

If you're home sick add an event in the `KREW AFK` calendar with a title like this:
`[SICK] $NICKNAME`

## Leaving early / Running errands

If you're not feeling creative or motivated or just not getting
anything done just go home and take a break. Need to run some errands
during the day, just do it anytime.

## Working from home

Working remotely is A-OK once in a while is A-OK, but we feel like
longer stretches of remote work, is bad socially for the team. If
coming into the office feels like a drag we have bigger issues to fix,
if you don't feel like coming in to the office talk to your manager
about it ASAP.

If you're working remotely, tell your team in your team-chat on Slack.

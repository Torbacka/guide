# How we report bugs at Klira
This is mostly ~stolen from~ inspired by http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#bespecific

Developers generally have [alot](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html) 
on their minds and we have more projects going on than you might know. While your question might be obvious to you, the recipient
might lack the context and having to spend time figguring context out will not only make people less keen on trying to answer
your question, but it will allso mean that doing so will take more time. So if you have context please, share it in a consies
manner so that the recipient can quickly get up to speed.

## Use meaningful, specific subjects
The first message in chat applications and the subject line in mails are possibly your most important line of communiucation.
Your goal is to quickly pique the interest of the most quallified person to answer it.

One good convention for subject headers, used by many tech support organizations, is “object - deviation”.
The “object” part specifies what thing or group of things is having a problem,
and the “deviation” part describes the deviation from expected behavior.

Stupid:

    HELP! Website dosnt work!
Smart:
    Submitionform, not loading the text on my computer
    
Smarter:
    Submitionform, personal information is not loading, just "pleas wait", only on my computer

## Provide context
If possible provide a link, or screenshot to the broken data.

Considder WHAT the problem is and use the form of data that you think is most rellevant for that. 

 * If the problem is with layout, looks or interaction-elements of a program or a web-page a screenshot is probbably the most usefull thing to attach to an error report.
 * If the problem concerns [data or information](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) that is some info that you are expecting is not appearing or is not correct copying and pasting the text is probbably the best choise. This is because it enables us to easily work with the data without having to type it of a screenshot. A screenshot might allso be relevant but always considder pasting raw text if possible.

If you provide a link check if the problem allso occurs if you paste the link in an anonymous browser window. Both since this i since an annonymous browser window is more likely to act like our computers do.

# Governance

The Klira guide is a complete description of the policies to everyone
on the `Klira team`. Any member of the team may propose changes to the
guide, this is done through a `pull-request`. Changes are approved
when they are merged into this Git repository, and unless otherwise
specified effective immediately.

## Merging pull requests

Pull requests may only be merged after being reviewed. Anyone may
merge a pull-request given that it has been properly reviewed and
approved. Anyone may at any time review and choose to approve, reject
or comment on a pull-request. If a majority of the reviewers
reject a change it may not be merged.

- Changes to formatting, spelling and grammar may be merged after
  being reviewed and approved by 1 team member excluding the proposer.
- Informational or educational content may be merged after being
  reviewed and approved by 1 team member excluding the proposer.
- Changes prescribing behaviour or prohibiting certain behaviours must
  be reviewed by 3 team members excluding the proposer. If the change
  is major and broadly affects the team, the PR must be kept open for
  3 weekdays.

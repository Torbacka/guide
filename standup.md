# Daily Standup

We have a two step standup process at 9am, `@standup_alice` asks in
#standup what everyone is doing. Make sure to answer those questions before 10am.
Everyones answers are summarized and put in a thread.

At 11am we have an IRL standup in the office where you present what
you told the bot. It is OK to ask minor questions about someones
answer. But we try to keep longer discussions for afterwards.

Right after the standup is a great time for asking questions if you
need information about if you need some information or are curious
about a project.

## Questions

- What have you been doing since last time?
- What do you plan on doing today?
- Are there any blockers?
- Is there anything you want to discuss with the rest of the team?
